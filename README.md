# **Face Emotion Recognition**

**Face Emotion Recognition**

The process of recognizing facial emotions is known as facial emotion recognition. The human brain recognizes emotions automatically, and software has now been developed that can recognize them as well. This technology is becoming more accurate all the time, and it is also becoming easier to use. Artificial intelligence is capable of detecting emotion by learning what each facial expression means and then applying that knowledge to the new information presented to the system. Emotional artificial intelligence is a technology that can read, imitate, interpret, and respond to human emotions.

The Human facial expressions are often presented in a visual manner. They help us understand the world around us. The use of facial expression recognition technology has numerous applications in areas such as mental disorders, drug abuse detection, and machine learning. Despite the numerous advantages of facial expression recognition technology, it is still challenging for a computer to recognize and classify facial expressions. Two popular methods are based on appearance and geometry.

**Introduction**

The Indian education landscape has been undergoing rapid changes for the past 10 years owing to the advancement of web-based learning services, specifically, eLearning platforms.
Global E-learning is estimated to witness an 8X over the next 5 years to reach USD 2B in 2021. India is expected to grow with a CAGR of 44% crossing the 10M users mark in 2021. Although the market is growing on a rapid scale, there are major challenges associated with digital learning when compared with brick and mortar classrooms. One of many challenges is how to ensure quality learning for students. Digital platforms might overpower physical classrooms in terms of content quality but when it comes to understanding whether students can grasp the content in a live class scenario is yet an open-end challenge.
In a physical classroom during a lecture, the teacher can see the faces, assess the emotion of the class and tune their lecture accordingly, whether he is going fast or slow. He can identify students who need special attention. Digital classrooms are conducted via the videotelephony software program (ex-Zoom) where medium-scale classes (25-50) can’t see all students and access the mood. Because of this drawback, students are not focusing on content due to lack of surveillance. Digital platforms have limitations in terms of physical surveillance but it comes with the power of data and machines which can work for you. It provides data in the form of video, audio, and texts which can be analysed using deep learning algorithms. Deep learning backed systems not only solves the surveillance issue, but it also removes the human bias from the system, and all information is no longer in the teacher’s brain rather translated into numbers that can be analysed and tracked.

**Problem Statement**

We will solve the above-mentioned challenge by applying deep learning algorithms to live video data. The solution to this problem is by recognizing facial emotions.
